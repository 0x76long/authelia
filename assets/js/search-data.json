    "content": "The default hash algorithm is Argon2id version 19 with a salt. Argon2id is currently considered the best hashing algorithm, and in 2015 won the Password Hashing Competition. It benefits from customizable parameters allowing the cost of computing a hash to scale into the future which makes it harder to brute-force. Argon2id was implemented due to community feedback as you can see in this closed issue. For backwards compatibility and user choice support for the SHA512 algorithm is still available. While it’s a reasonable hashing function given high enough iterations, as hardware improves it has a higher chance of being brute-forced. Hashes are identifiable as argon2id or SHA512 by their prefix of either $argon2id$ and $6$ respectively, as described in this wiki page. Important Note: When using argon2id Authelia will appear to remain using the memory allocated to creating the hash. This is due to how Go allocates memory to the heap when generating an argon2id hash. Go periodically garbage collects the heap, however this doesn’t remove the memory allocation, it keeps it allocated even though it’s technically unused. Under memory pressure the unused allocated memory will be reclaimed by the operating system, you can test this on linux with: . $ stress-ng --vm-bytes $(awk '/MemFree/{printf \"%d\\n\", $2 * 0.9;}' &lt; /proc/meminfo)k --vm-keep -m 1 . If this is not desirable we recommend investigating the following options in order of most to least secure: . | using the LDAP authentication provider | adjusting the memory parameter | changing the algorithm | . Password hash algorithm tuning . All algorithm tuning for Argon2id is supported. The only configuration variables that affect SHA512 are iterations and salt length.

Please note that the backend must support the use of those headers to leverage that information, many backends still don’t (and probably won’t) support it. However, we are working on solving this issue with OpenID Connect/OAuth2 which is a widely adopted open standard for access delegation. So, if you’re developing your own application, you can read those headers and use them. If you don’t own the codebase of the backend, you need to check whether it supports this type of authentication or not. If it does not, you have three options: . | Enable authentication on the backend and make your users authenticate twice (not user-friendly). | Completely disable the authentication of your backend. This works only if all your users share the same privileges in the backend. | Many applications support OAuth2 so the last option would be to just wait for Authelia to be an OpenID Connect provider (https://github.com/authelia/authelia/issues/189). | .

First and foremost Authelia only uses very secure hashing algorithms with sane and secure defaults. The first and default hashing algorithm we use is Argon2id which is currently considered the most secure hashing algorithm. We also support SHA512, which previously was the default. Secondly Authelia uses salting with all hashing algorithms. These salts are generated with a random string generator, which is seeded every time it’s used by a cryptographically secure 1024bit prime number. This ensures that even if an attacker obtains the file, each password has to be brute forced individually. Lastly Authelia’s implementation of Argon2id is highly tunable. You can tune the key length, salt used, iterations (time), parallelism, and memory usage. To read more about this please read how to configure file authentication. ",

    "content": "By default the SMTP Notifier implementation does not allow connections that are not secure. As such all connections require the following: . | TLS Connection (STARTTLS or SMTPS) has been negotiated before authentication or sending emails (unauthenticated connections require it as well) | Valid X509 Certificate presented to the client during the TLS handshake | . There is an option to disable both of these security measures however they are not recommended. You should only do this in a situation where you control all networks between Authelia and the SMTP server. The following configuration options exist to configure the security level: . SMTPS vs STARTTLS . By default all connections start as plain text and are upgraded via STARTTLS. SMTPS is supported, however due to the fact it was basically considered deprecated before the turn of the century, there is no way to configure it. It happens automatically when a SMTP notifier is configured with the SMTPS port of 465. Configuration Option: disable_verify_cert . This is a YAML boolean type (true/false, y/n, 1/0, etc). This disables the X509 PKI verification mechanism. We recommend using the trusted_cert option over this, as disabling this security feature makes you vulnerable to MITM attacks. Configuration Option: disable_require_tls . This is a YAML boolean type (true/false, y/n, 1/0, etc). This disables the requirement that all connections must be over TLS. This is only usable currently with authentication disabled (comment the password) and as such is only an option for SMTP servers that allow unauthenticated relay (bad practice). Configuration Option: trusted_cert . This is a YAML string type. This specifies the file location of a pub certificate that can be used to validate the authenticity of a server with a self signed certificate. This can either be the public cert of the certificate authority used to sign the certificate or the public key itself. They must be in the PEM format. The certificate is added in addition to the certificates trusted by the host machine. If the certificate is invalid, inaccessible, or is otherwise not configured; Authelia just uses the hosts certificates. Explanation . There are a few reasons for the security measures implemented: . | Transmitting username’s and passwords over plain-text is an obvious vulnerability | The emails generated by Authelia, if transmitted in plain-text could allow an attacker to intercept a link used to setup 2FA; which reduces security | Not validating the identity of the server allows man-in-the-middle attacks | .

This is used to encrypt the session data when when stored in the Redis key value database. This should be as random as possible. Additionally you can configure the validity period of sessions. For example in a highly security conscious domain you would probably want to set the session remember_me_duration to 0 to disable this feature, and set an expiration of something like 2 hours and inactivity of 10 minutes. This means the hard limit or the time the session will be destroyed no matter what is 2 hours, and the soft limit or the time a user can be inactive for is 10 minutes.

Configures the period of time in seconds a one-time password is current for. It is important to note that changing this value will require your users to register their application again. It is recommended to keep this value set to 30, the minimum is 1. Skew . Configures the number of one-time passwords either side of the current one that are considered valid, each time you increase this it makes two more one-time passwords valid. For example the default of 1 has a total of 3 keys valid. A value of 2 has 5 one-time passwords valid. It is recommended to keep this value set to 0 or 1, the minimum is 0. ",

We also try to balance features and improvements as much as possible with the maintenance tasks we have to perform to keep the backlog of open issues in a reasonable state. If you’re willing to contribute and help us move forward faster, get in touch with us on Matrix. We’ll be glad to share ideas and plans with you. Below are the prioritised roadmap items: . | Authelia acts as an OpenID Connect Provider. This is a high priority because currently the only way to pass authentication information back to the protected app is through the use of HTTP headers as described here however, many apps either do not support this method or are starting to move away from this in favour of OpenID Connect or OAuth2 internally or via plugins. | Administration interface. This is useful in many cases to properly manage users and administrate activities like unbanning banned users. In the future we can even think of adding/removing users from there, request a password reset for a user or all users, request a 2FA enrollment, temporarily block users, etc… . | User interface. This will help the users manage their 2FA devices, reset their password, review their authentication activity. In the future we envisage users will be able to customize their profile with an avatar, set their preferences regarding 2FA and according to the global policy defined by administrators, etc… . | Facilitate setup on Kubernetes. There are mainly two objectives here. First, we need to provide the documentation required to setup Authelia on Kubernetes. Even though, some users already have it working and the feature is even tested in the project, there is a clear lack of documentation. The second item is to provide a Helm chart to streamline the setup on Kubernetes. | . ",

Sessions can have both soft and hard limits. With soft limit, the user is logged out when inactive for a certain period. With hard limit, the user has to authenticate again after a certain period, whether they were active or not. | Brute force attacks against credentials are protected thanks to a regulation mechanism temporarily blocking the user account after too many attempts. | Identity validation is required for performing administrative actions such as registering 2FA devices, preventing attackers to pass second factor by auto-registering their own 2FA device. An email with a link is sent to the user and a click is required to confirm the action. | Prevention against session fixation by regenerating a new session after each privilege elevation. | Prevention against LDAP injection by following OWASP recommendations regarding valid input characters (https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/LDAP_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html). | Connections between Authelia and thirdparty components like mail server, database, cache and LDAP server can be made over TLS to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks from within the infrastructure. | Validation of user session group memberships gets refreshed regularly from the authentication backend (LDAP only). | .

A mitigation could be to transmit those headers with a digital signature which could be verified by the backend however, many backends just don’t support it.
